# Download Packages

As stated in the documentation relative to the [configuration specification] a module or an add-on is
identified with a **name** and a **version**.  
With this two pieces of information we will have to reference unequivocally a bundle of one or more file to download.

In the [modules] and [addons] documentation is stated that we expect a certain folder structure inside the repository
that is containing the modules and/or add-ons and how we expect the tags name for referencing the correct versions.

In this documentation will outline how all of this is tied together and what at high level the download will do
for retriving the correct files to use.
